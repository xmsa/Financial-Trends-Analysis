### Financial Trends Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing financial market trends using historical stock data. The primary objective is to explore patterns in stock prices, detect correlations with macroeconomic indicators, and predict future trends using machine learning models. 

Key tasks include:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering using financial data sources (Yahoo Finance, Google Finance).
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, volatility, and patterns in stock price movements.
- Implementing regression models and machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices.
- Visualizing market trends through various plots and charts.
- Evaluating the models' performance using various metrics like MAE and RMSE.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to financial data analysis and can be extended to create real-time prediction models for stock market forecasting.

Tools used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data from Yahoo Finance
